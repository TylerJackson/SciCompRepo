      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION:\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this lab we explored three difference methods for finding the roots of a non-linear equation.  The first we examined was the bisection method which uses an interval surrounding the root.  The interval gets smaller based on each iteration.  In the bisection method you test the midpoint of the interval and see if it is a root.  If it is not, you check if the root is less than or greater than the midpoint.  You then recursively perform the bisection method again with a new interval based on whether the root was in the lower half of your original interval or the upper half.  The more iterations you run, the more your midpoint zeros in on the actual root.  \n",
      "    \n",
      "    The newton method uses an initial prediction for the root, and the tangent line of this guess.  For example if our guess is Xo, then the tangent line would be the tangent line to the curve that corresponds to f(Xo).  It then takes the intersection of this tangent line with the x-axis and this value becomes our new guess for the root.  The more iterations you perform, the more this intersection value gets closer to the root.  We expect this method to be more efficient than the bisection method, because it only needs one value of the function, while the bisection method uses two to create the interval.  \n",
      "    \n",
      "    The third method we examined for finding roots is a variation of the newton method called the forward difference newton method.  This method is identical to the newton method, except instead of using the functions derivative, it uses the finite forward approximation of the function's derivative.  If you recall, this is the approximation we explored in lab 1.  This approximation uses a very small change in 'x' (which we call alpha) to calculate the slope at 'x'.  Recall that the slope is the change in f(x) divided by the change in x.  Just like in lab 1, we expect the best value of alpha to be small but not too small.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "   In all of these methods we set a tolerance for the amount of error we are willing to accept.  Therefore, as the tolerance becomes smaller, we expect our approximation for the root to become more and more accurate.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    After testing these three methods we applied them to a real life function.  We were given an equation that maximized the power output of a solar cell (provided on the project description).  The power output was dependent on the voltage emitted by the cell.  Therefore we were instructed to calculate the voltage that would maximize the power ouput.  In order to do this we just solved this equation for V.  In order to use our methods for finding roots we simply set this equation equal to zero, and then the root of the function was the voltage value we were looking for.  Similarly to when we were testing the method above, we varied the tolerance we allowed for error, and also the alpha value (for the forward difference newton method) in order to see what the best voltage would be.\n",

      "    This was a good function to test, because as you can see the three roots are 0,3,and -1.  From our results we can easily see the roots 3, and -1.  For both of these methods we varied the tolerance from 10^-2, to 10^-6, to 10^-10.  Notice how the approximations for the roots become more accurate as our tolerance becomes smaller just like we expected.  For newton's method (refer to first set of test 1-8) we tried a couple different values for our initial guess.  Our initial guesses for our root were -2 and 2.  When we used -2 as our initial guess, the method found the root x= -1, and when we used 2 as our initial guess the method found the root x=3.  This is interesting to note that the method will find whichever root is closest to the initial guess.  In order to test this hypothesis I performed one extra test with the initial guess of x=1.  This is closest to the root x=0, and as you can see, the method returned the root x=0.  I also wanted to see if the amount of iterations would vary based on our initial guess of x.  I hypothesized that as the initial guess gets farther away from the actual root, the iterations necessary to find an approximation within our accepted tolerance would increase.  If you refer to test 8 in the ouput you can see the amount of iterations performed drastically increased when I made my initial guess for the root x= 100.  Therefore our hypothesis was supported.\n",

      "    For the forward difference newton method (refer to second set of tests 1-18), notice we change the value of alpha from 2^-6, to 2^-26, to 2^-48.  Recall that we hypothesized the optimal value for alpha would be small, but not extremely small (just like lab 1), because as alpha gets to small the approximation for the derivative gets worse.  Therefore, we would expect the results with alpha = 2^-26 to have the smallest error.  If you refer to the results above, you must compare the cases where everything is consistent except for alpha.  As you can see when there is error (if there is error) the approximations that used 2^-26 have an error one tenth of the error from the approximations using 2^-48.  If we were to alter the initial guesses of x, we would expect to see similar variations in results as we did for the regular newton method.  This is because the methods are the same as far as our initial guess is concerned.  As mentioned above, the only place they differ is the derivative approximation.      \n",

      "    For the application of our three methods on the maximum power output equation (refer to third set of tests 1-15) we used bisection, then the newton method, then the forward difference newton method.  Notice how with all three methods the voltage that results in maximum power output is approximately .71036 Volts.  When using the forward difference newton's method it is clear that the approximations with the smallest error come when alpha is 2^-26, and when the tolerance is smallest.  This is as we predicted.\n",

      "    From the third set of tests we are able to evaluate which methods are easiest to use, and which are most efficient.  In order to analyze the efficiency of the method, we can compare the iterations needed to find an error within our tolerance, as well as the ability to find an accurate approximation.  As you can see all three methods find accurate approximations.  However, if we look at the iterations needed, the two newton methods need fewer iterations to find an accurate approximation.  This is really emphasized when we want an approximation within 10^-10 of the actual root.  Therefore, the two newton methods are more efficient than the bisection method.  This makes sense because the newton methods use an approximation based on the tangent line to the curve, while the bisection simply tries the midpoint of the interval each time.  Therefore the bisection method only halves the interval each time, while the newton methods can narrow the next guess more quickly.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    When analyzing which method is easiest to use we need to consider what arguments the methods need, and the difficulty in finding these arguments.  The bisection method needs only the function to work because it simply shortens the interval each iteration to close in on the root.  However, the newton method needs the derivative as well as the function to work.  The forward difference newton method doesn't need the derivative, but it still requires a function to approximate the derivative.  Therefore the bisection method is easiest to use, then the forward difference newton method, and then the newton method.  \n",
